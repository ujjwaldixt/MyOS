 *
 * We pass 'InterruptNumber + interruptManager->HardwareInterruptOffset()'
 * to the InterruptHandler constructor because hardware interrupts and software
 * interrupts are often offset in the IDT. This ensures we register the correct
 * entry in the IDT for the syscall vector.

 * HandleInterrupt:
 *   - This method is called whenever a system call interrupt occurs (e.g., int 0x80).
 *   - 'esp' is the current stack pointer, which contains the CPUState snapshot.
 *   - We cast 'esp' to CPUState* to access registers (eax, ebx, etc.).
 *
 * The switch statement checks cpu->eax to identify which system call is requested.
 * For example:
 *   - case 4: treat it as a "print string" system call. The address of the string is in ebx.
 *
 * Returns the (potentially modified) stack pointer.
