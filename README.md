# MyOS
- Created a mini OS using C++ and AMD64 Assembly, focusing on hardware interaction.
- Developed hardware drivers for monitors, PCI devices and hard drives and ensured POSIX compliance.
- Implemented device interrupt handling, multi-tasking and dynamic memory management support.

### Build steps
- You will need VirtualBox to run this OS.
- sudo apt-get install g++ binutils libc6-dev-i386
- sudo apt-get install VirtualBox grub-legacy xorriso
- Write make to run the program once all the dependencies are installed.
